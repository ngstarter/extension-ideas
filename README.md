# extension-ideas
You can contribute and propose new extensions here by posting it as issues.
You can contribute by:
- Posting ideas
- Posting proposal, and demo repo (will be forked to here if approved :star:)

## Guidelines
1. Make it for one purpose, and small
2. Make sure you define the `peerDependencies` if you use the same package in Angular 2 Starter
3. Make a good `Getting started` on how to use your extension
